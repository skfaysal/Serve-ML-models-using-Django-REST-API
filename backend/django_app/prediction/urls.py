This is saying that we are adding ‘predict’ to the URL path /api/ so that if we make api URL requests such as
http://www.our-final-app.com/api/predict/ we would be taken to the IRIS_Model_Predict view,
from which we should get a predicted response back for a sample iris flower data sent along with the request.
